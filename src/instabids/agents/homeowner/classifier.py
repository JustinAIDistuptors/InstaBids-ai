    Classifies a project based on its description and optional image analysis results.

    This is a placeholder implementation. In a real scenario, this function would likely:
    1. Construct a prompt for an LLM, including the project description and key findings
       from image_analysis_results.
    2. Call the LLM to get structured output for categories and job types with confidence.
    3. Potentially use embeddings or other ML techniques for more robust classification.

    Args:
        project_description (str): The user's description of the project.
        image_analysis_results (Optional[List[Dict[str, Any]]]): Results from image analysis.
        # llm_client: An instance of an LLM client if direct LLM calls are made here.

    Returns:
        Tuple containing:
        - primary_category (str): The most likely primary category.
        - primary_job_type (str): The most likely job type within the primary category.
        - primary_confidence (float): Confidence score for the primary classification.
        - secondary_category (str): The second most likely primary category.
        - secondary_job_type (str): The most likely job type within the secondary category.
        - secondary_confidence (float): Confidence score for the secondary classification.
        - tertiary_category (str): The third most likely primary category.
        - tertiary_job_type (str): The most likely job type within the tertiary category.
        - tertiary_confidence (float): Confidence score for the tertiary classification.
        - classification_details (Dict[str, Any]): Additional details or raw output from classification.
